            <h3 class="faq-title">What is the difference between a Therapist and a Psychiatrist?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
            Therapists go deep into our problems with us. They help us understand ourselves better and plan for recovery without using medicines.
             Psychiatrists diagnose and treat chronic mental health conditions and may use medicines.

            <h3 class="faq-title">What does a Therapy pack offer?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
            A Therapy pack helps with continuity of your wellness journey,
             without having to bother about booking sessions one at a time.
              Your Therapist will recommend the number of sessions that you might need to address your challenges.
             We recommend you buy a pack only after a discussion with the therapist.
